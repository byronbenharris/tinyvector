## ‚ú® Features
- __Tiny__: It's in the name. It's literally just an axum server. Extremely easy to customize, around 600 lines of code.
- __Fast__: Tinyvector should have comparable speed to advanced vector databases when it comes on small to medium datasets, and slightly better accuracy.
- __Vertically Scales__: Tinyvector stores all indexes in memory for fast querying. Very easy to scale up to 100 million+ vector dimensions without issue.
- __Open Source__: MIT Licensed, free forever.

### Soon
- __Integrated Models__: Soon you won't have to bring your own vectors, just generate them on the server automaticaly. Will support SBert, Hugging Face models, OpenAI, Cohere, etc.
- __Python/JS Client__: We'll add a comprehensive Python and Javascript package for easy integration with tinyvector in the next two weeks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üê≥ Docker

We provide a lightweight Docker container that you can run anywhere. It only takes one command to get up and running with the latest changes:

```sh
docker run \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  ghcr.io/m1guelpf/tinyvector:edge
```

> **Note**
> When running via Docker Compose or Kubernetes, make sure to bind a volume to `/tinyvector/storage` for persistence. This is handled automatically in the command above.

### üõ†Ô∏è Building from scratch

You can build tinyvector from the latest tagged release by running `cargo install tinyvector` (you might need to [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/) first). Then, run `tinyvector` to start up the server.
 
You can also build it from the latest commit by cloning the repo and running `cargo build --release`, and run it with `./target/release/tinyvector`.

### Routes

- **List Collections** - GET `/`
- **Create Collection** - POST `/`
- **Edit Collection** - PUT `/`
- **Delete Collection** - DELETE `/`
- **Query Collection** - GET `/:collection_name`
- **Insert Vector** - POST `/:collection_name`
- **Edit Vectors** - PUT `/:collection_name`
- **Delete Vectors** - DELETE `/:collection_name`
- **Get Collection Info** - GET `/:collection_name/info`

## üí° Why use tinyvector?

Most vector databases are overkill for simple setups. For example:
- Using embeddings to chat with your documents. Most document search is nowhere close to what you'd need to justify accelerating search speed with [HNSW](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) or [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).
- Doing search for your website or store. Unless you're selling 1,000,000 items, you don't need Pinecone.

## üß© Embeddings?

Embeddings are a way to compare similar things, in the same way humans compare similar things, by converting text into a small list of numbers. Similar pieces of text will have similar numbers, different ones have very different numbers.

Read OpenAI's [explanation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings).

## üôè Acknowledgements

- Will Depue's [tinyvector](https://twitter.com/willdepue/status/1675796236304252928) (python+sqlite+numpy) inspired me to build a vector database from scratch (and borrow the name). Will also contributed plenty of ideas to optimize performance.
